AutoLayoutTester
================

Swift project to test auto layout behavior of a view

## Usage

1. Build a view with auto layout (you can use ```TestView.swift``` and ```TestView.xib``` as an example)
2. Edit the ```Main.storyboard``` and change the Custom Class > Class of "Test View" to your class.
3. Start the simulator and drag the arrows around to resize the view and see how your constraints work.

I developed this tool as a helper for a series of articles I'll be posting to my website.  Stay tuned for details!
